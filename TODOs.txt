Aside TODOs mentioned in code I'll list some here whenever I want to mark an important TODO:
- Keep **ONLY** declarations in header files and move all definitions inside a corresponding .cpp file

Render function should not render immediately, rather it should put the texture to a render queue. Also each texture
should be able to have a rendering_priority setting, and no matter the order in which all textures' render functions
are called, they should always obey the rendering_priority.
