Aside TODOs mentioned in code I'll list some here whenever I want to mark an important TODO:

    -Render function should not render immediately, rather it should put the texture to a render queue. Also each texture
    should be able to have a rendering_priority setting, and no matter the order in which all textures' render functions
    are called, they should always obey the rendering_priority.

    -Localize all code (no globals, everything should be instantiable)

    -Import/Export PGN file

    -Tester


Bugs to fix:
    -Games with multiple queens on the same color tend to have a problem because the program assumes there can only be a single queen per player
    -Some specific en passant games fail, check the problem (one of the problems is when a pawn check with en passant, it always fails)
