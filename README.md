# sdlchess
Simple chess game to get acquainted with SDL 2.0 library for gamedev (written in C++).
Whilst you are playing, if you press the M button, you will get to see the notation of the game you just played.
I also created a tester with PGN parser, I tested a few thousand games from GMs by downloading pgn files, it works for all of them.
