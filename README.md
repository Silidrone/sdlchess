# sdlchess
Simple chess game to get acquainted with SDL 2.0 library for gamedev (written in C++).
Whilst you are playing, if you press the M button, you will get to see the notation of the game you just played.
I still haven't found time to create a tester for the game as I am unsure if it works 100% correctly. When I find the time I am planning to create a parser for PGN (Portable Game Notation) files and simulate as many games as possible and see if any fails to be played out. I am also planning to add download for game notation in PGN format.
