# sdlchess
This is my hobby project to write a simple chess game to get acquainted with the SDL 2.0 library.
Whilst you are playing, if you press the M button, you will get to see the notation of the game you just played.
I also created a tester with PGN parser, I tested a few thousand games from GMs by downloading pgn files, it works for all of them.
